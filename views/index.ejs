                Advanced Java refers to advanced topics and APIs used in Java
                programming beyond the basics covered in core Java. It includes
                technologies like Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), JDBC (Java
                Database Connectivity), and frameworks like Spring, Hibernate,
                and Struts. These technologies are essential for developing
                enterprise-level applications, web services, and scalable
                backend systems. Advanced Java emphasizes concepts such as
                multithreading, networking, and database interaction, offering
                robust solutions for dynamic web development and
                enterprise-level software architecture. Mastering Advanced Java
                is crucial for developers aiming to build sophisticated,
                scalable, and high-performance Java applications.
